DevBack

DevBack

DevBack is a website designed to bridge the gap between open-source contributors and the community that benefits from their work. By pulling data from GitHub, DevBack allows users to:

View the top contributors of their favorite open-source libraries and projects.

Donate cryptocurrency (Starknet coin) directly to the open-source developers they admire and support.

We believe this initiative is crucial to addressing the decline in open-source development and revitalizing this vital part of the software community. By enabling contributions and recognizing the hard work of developers, we aim to foster a thriving ecosystem of innovation and collaboration.

Why DevBack Matters

Open-source software powers a significant portion of the technology we use daily. However, many developers contribute their time and expertise without adequate recognition or compensation. This has led to a decline in open-source contributions, threatening the innovation and accessibility that define our software community.

DevBack is our way of giving back to the developers who make this ecosystem possible. By connecting users with contributors and facilitating direct donations, we hope to:

Support developers financially to continue their invaluable work.

Promote awareness of the importance of open-source contributions.

Build a more collaborative and sustainable software community.
